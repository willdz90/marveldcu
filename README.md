# Getting Started with MARVEL DCU COMICS App
This project was created using React, React query and the styles were given by Styled Components.

                  https://marveldcu.vercel.app/
              
Initially you are going to redirect to the Homepage, this is a single page to show the multimedia info of the app, next to the homepage in the menu bar into the Character item, you can find all the characters by page

To start with this project it is highly recommended to check the API website, it is necesary to get the API key and configure it inside the .env file.

The project has a couple recommendations:

First allow do not modify the package.json, some of the scripts needs to be at the version that they have been install, this because there are a few problems to solve mainly with the webpack version 5.

For the deploy, it is necesary to make with the node 16.x version, this because when you try to deploy the project with a high version you must consider the follow "Node.js version 16.x has reached End-of-Life. Deployments created on or after 2023-08-15 will fail to build. Please set Node.js Version to 18.x in your Project Settings to use Node.js 18."

For the next steps check the https://developer.marvel.com/docs API website it contains the information about authorizations and querys that are available for the project.

Once you give a check to the API's doc consider to use an converter to get the REACT_APP_HASH because this is a combo of the API key and a TS in md5 format.

And that will be all for now, to continue with the installation of the project, Enjoy it, and I will be attend for any recommendations of bugs into it.

# Happy Coding. Greetings!
